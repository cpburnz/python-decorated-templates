- Fix traceback lines. They still do not work even though line numbers
  are properly set on the function AST. The simple tests from
  "./pdt/test/test_traceback.py" display the proper line numbers in the
  tracebacks, but ``render()`` from "./pdt/test/test.py" displays the
  absurd line number of 2226 instead of 178. Adding arbitrary empty
  string expressions before the exception raises the line number by 257.
